# ztm_vulnbruteforce.py
Simple python program to brute force metasploitable2 VM. 

This program is designed to perform a simple brute force using hydra on the metasploitable2 VM 
(bruteforce page). The program was taken from ZTM Complete Ethical Hacking 2023 course. Some 
changes were made to the original course program as I was unsuccessful getting it to work. 
This program was corrected using chatgpt and has been tested to work on the metasploitable2 VM.
